Project Title: Health Tracker

Description:

Health Tracker is a mobile application designed to help users monitor and track their vital health metrics. The app provides a user-friendly interface to log and visualize data related to blood pressure, heart rate, SpO2 levels, stress levels, and more. Users can easily record their daily measurements, view historical data, and gain insights into their overall health trends.

Setup Instructions:

Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone <your-repository-url>
Navigate to the project directory:

Bash

cd <project-directory>
Install dependencies:

Bash

flutter pub get
Run the application:

Bash

flutter run
